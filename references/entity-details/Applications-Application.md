## Usage Examples

### JavaScript
```javascript
// Example application object
const application = {
  applicationId: 12345,
  name: "My Destiny App",
  applicationType: 1, // Confidential
  redirectUrl: "https://myapp.com/oauth/callback",
  link: "https://myapp.com",
  scope: 97, // Combined scopes: 1 + 32 + 64 (ReadBasicUserProfile + MoveEquipDestinyItems + ReadDestinyInventoryAndVault)
  origin: "https://myapp.com",
  status: 3, // Public
  creationDate: "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  statusChanged: "2023-01-20T14:45:00Z",
  firstPublished: "2023-01-20T14:45:00Z",
  team: [
    {
      developerId: 67890,
      role: 1, // Owner
      membershipId: 11111,
      displayName: "AppDeveloper"
    }
  ],
  overrideAuthorizeViewName: null
};

// Working with application data
console.log(`Application: ${application.name} (ID: ${application.applicationId})`);
console.log(`Type: ${application.applicationType === 1 ? 'Confidential' : 'Public'}`);
console.log(`Scopes: ${application.scope}`);
console.log(`Team members: ${application.team.length}`);

// Check if application has specific scope
const hasInventoryAccess = (application.scope & 64) !== 0; // ReadDestinyInventoryAndVault
console.log(`Has inventory access: ${hasInventoryAccess}`);
```

### Python
```python
from datetime import datetime

# Example application object
application = {
    "applicationId": 12345,
    "name": "My Destiny App",
    "applicationType": 1,  # Confidential
    "redirectUrl": "https://myapp.com/oauth/callback",
    "link": "https://myapp.com",
    "scope": 97,  # Combined scopes: 1 + 32 + 64
    "origin": "https://myapp.com",
    "status": 3,  # Public
    "creationDate": "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "statusChanged": "2023-01-20T14:45:00Z",
    "firstPublished": "2023-01-20T14:45:00Z",
    "team": [
        {
            "developerId": 67890,
            "role": 1,  # Owner
            "membershipId": 11111,
            "displayName": "AppDeveloper"
        }
    ],
    "overrideAuthorizeViewName": None
}

# Working with application data
print(f"Application: {application['name']} (ID: {application['applicationId']})")
print(f"Type: {'Confidential' if application['applicationType'] == 1 else 'Public'}")
print(f"Scopes: {application['scope']}")
print(f"Team members: {len(application['team'])}")

# Check if application has specific scope
has_inventory_access = (application['scope'] & 64) != 0  # ReadDestinyInventoryAndVault
print(f"Has inventory access: {has_inventory_access}")

# Parse creation date
creation_date = datetime.fromisoformat(application['creationDate'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
print(f"Created: {creation_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
```

## Related Entities
- **Applications.OAuthApplicationType**: Defines the application type (Confidential/Public)
- **Applications.ApplicationStatus**: Defines the current status of the application
- **Applications.ApplicationScopes**: Defines the permission scopes
- **Applications.ApplicationDeveloper**: Team members managing the application
- **Applications.ApiUsage**: Usage statistics for the application

## Notes
- The applicationId is unique across all applications in the system
- The scope field is a bitwise combination of ApplicationScopes values
- Confidential applications can keep secrets secure (server-side apps)
- Public applications cannot keep secrets secure (client-side apps)
- The team array always contains at least the application owner
- The redirectUrl is used for OAuth2 authorization flow
- Applications must be approved by Bungie before they can access user data
